\section{CONCLUSION}

\paragraph{}
We implemented the 2 differents algorithms and tried without succes to implement them in parallel. We also found some diffculty to use the algorithm on real picture because they are only working well on \textit{fake} picture (created in the code with a unique color). To conclude, we can say that the algorithms are good in theorical but not in practice with real case
