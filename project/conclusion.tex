\section{CONCLUSION}

\paragraph{}
We implemented the 2 differents algorithms and tried without succes to implement them in parallel. We also got some diffculties to use the algorithm on real picture because they are only working well on \textit{fake} contour (created in the code). We implemented some calculs in parallel but they weren't efficient to improve the speed of the computing (Only on simple calcul but not in a global way). It was maybe an error from us to use the DGtal library to try to implement them in openCL and CUDA.
