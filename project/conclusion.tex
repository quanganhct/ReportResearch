\section{CONCLUSION}

\paragraph{}
After finishing this project, I have obtained many knowledge, first of all, is the usage of \textit{Rodin} and the way to define a system in a logical way. I have to think about the problems that I have never thought about before when programming. And most importantly, is that I could find out that all my knowledges about boolean algebra are still useful, and it could contribute to build a system in a clear and logical way.
