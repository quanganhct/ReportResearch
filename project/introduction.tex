\section{INTRODUCTION}

\paragraph{}
In the last lesson of Formal Design, we were given a project to finish individually. Our job is to design a sorted array in ascending order, and a method to confirm if one array is sorted.  

\paragraph{}
I used a software, named \textbf{Rodin}, to do this project. There were three steps needed in this project

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition of an array
\item Specification of a machine that will evaluate an array to see if it's sorted in ascending order
\item Implementation of the machine
\end{itemize}
