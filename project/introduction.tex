\section{INTRODUCTION}

\paragraph{}
The main target of this article is to implement different algorithms to calculate Curvature. To reach our goal, we studied differents scientific articles \cite{kerautret2008comparison} and then implement the algorithm for an parallel use. \newline This article is composed of two parts: Osculating Circles Estimator \& Binomial Convolution Curvature Estimator.  \newline The purpose of the comparison is to find the best algorithm to use to find curvature to classify different insect species.
