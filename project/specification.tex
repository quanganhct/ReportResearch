\section{MACHINE'S SPECIFICATION}

\paragraph{}
Our machine's job is to evaluate an array if it satisfies the condition, means that it is sorted in ascending order.  So we have to give the definition of the condition first

\paragraph{}
If an array satisfies the condition, we must have :
$$ \forall i, i \in 1..n-1 \implies array(i) \leq array(i+1) \quad \textit{(n is the size of array)}$$

\paragraph{}
Means that if an array doesn't satisfy the condition, we will have :
$$ \exists i, i \in 1..n-1 \implies array(i) > array(i+1) \quad \textit{(n is the size of array)} $$
